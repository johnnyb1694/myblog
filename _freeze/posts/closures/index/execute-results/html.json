If anything it's 'hot' for all the wrong reasons: we've all come across the error 'object of type closure is  not subsettable' before.\n\nYou can be a very capable data scientist and have no clue what a closure is. But, I actually *like* this stuff. Plus, this concept is something that is shared amongst other popular programming languages like JavaScript, Swift and Ruby so it's kind of useful to know what it is.\n\nSo, presuming you're not bored yet and still wondering what I'm on about, have a little look at the following code snippet and have a little think about what would happen if I called `g`. Try to think about it yourself before scrolling further!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Returns another function which has the ability to print the value for the symbol `text`\nf <- function() {\n  \n  text <- \"Here!\"\n  \n  function() {\n    print(text)\n  }\n}\n\n# Returns a call to the function returned by `f()` (above)\ng <- function() {\n  \n  text <- \"There!\"\n  \n  print_text <- f()\n  print_text()\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nHave you thought about it yet?\n\nGood. OK: here goes nothing!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ng()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"Here!\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBoom. Now, if you aren't a regular user of R this behaviour could be quite bemusing. For instance, we have defined two values for the symbol `text`: how does R select one of them?\n\nEven if you are a regular user of R, you may still be wondering *how* to explain this. And you wouldn't really be able to without first understanding the concept of closures and lexical scope. So let me attempt to elucidate things for you slightly :wink:\n\n## A simple example\n\nThe example shown above is a little bit complicated.\n\nSo let's start with something really simple and build up the complexity as we go. First, take a look at this function\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nopen <- function() {\n  x + 3\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou'll see why I've called it 'open' in a minute.\n\nMost users of R understand that if we tried to run `open`, as is, we would face an error because we haven't yet defined a value for `x` within the function body or within the global environment.\n\nLet's verify that with a quick call,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nopen()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in open(): object 'x' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis of course changes once we assign a value to the symbol `x`, say, within the global environment,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 2\n\nopen()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe question is: *how* does `open` locate a value for the symbol `x`? I mean, we haven't defined it inside the function body so how does `open` 'jump up' into the global environment whilst it is executing?\n\n## Expressions & closures\n\nTake a look at the following function `closed`,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclosed <- function(x, y) {\n  x + y\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis function is a *closed* expression because each and every symbol that is defined inside the body of `g` has a corresponding value (supplied as arguments to the parameters `x` and `y`).\n\nBy contrast, the aforementioned function `open` is an *open* expression,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nopen <- function() {\n  x + 3\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis is because the symbol `x` is not defined anywhere within the function itself. We call `x` a *free* variable in this context. It needs a value; it needs *closure*.\n\nWhen we created `open`, we assigned it to the global environment,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrlang::env_has(env = .GlobalEnv, nms = \"open\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nopen \nTRUE \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen you define a function inside a given context (say, the global environment, as we just did), that function will assign and *maintain* values associated with all of the *free* variables of that function expression which exist within the surrounding context (and the context surrounding *that* context and so on, recursively).\n\nPhew. That's a lot of words! Let's look at an example to make this a little easier to understand.\n\nFor example,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt <- 1\nu <- 2\nv <- 3\nx <- 10\n\nopen <- function() {\n  x + 3\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn this case, the surrounding environment of `open` is as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Surrounding context of 'open'\n{\n  t: 1,\n  u: 2,\n  v: 3,\n  x: 10\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe *closure* of `open` is a subset of this environment: it is the set of key-value pairs which transform `open` from an *open* expression into a *closed* expression. In this case, we only care about `x`,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Closure of 'open'\n{\n  x: 10\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis is what a closure is!\n\n## Inner functions\n\nLet's go back to our initial problem.\n\nWe have a function `f` that is defined like so,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Returns another function which has the ability to print the value for the symbol `text`\nf <- function() {\n  \n  text <- \"Here!\"\n  \n  function() {\n    print(text)\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nNotice that `f` returns a *function* as an output.\n\nI'm going to assign a name to this inner function to make things a bit easier to explain,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Returns another function which has the ability to print the value for the symbol `text`\nf <- function() {\n  \n  text <- \"Here!\"\n  \n  inner <- function() {\n    print(text)\n  }\n  \n  return(inner)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe important thing to note here, once again, is that the `inner` function is not *executed*, but is instead *defined* when `f` is called. So think of 'call `f`' and 'define `inner`' as being equivalent statements.\n\nWhen you run `f()`, here's what happens.\n\nFirst, you create another function (which I have just named `print_text`),\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint_text <- f()\n\nprint_text\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nfunction() {\n    print(text)\n  }\n<environment: 0x12004e7b8>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHowever, something else also happens behind the scenes which you don't see: upon definition, the inner function creates a *snapshot* of the free variables (i.e. `text`) in its surrounding context,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n{\n  text: \"Here!\"\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn effect, the inner function 'encloses' its surrounding context.\n\nThis is the *closure* of `inner` and this is how `inner` gets a value for `text`. This value is maintained even after `f` finishes executing.\n\n## Lexical scope versus dynamic scope\n\nThe concept of closures is closely related to the concept of lexical scope.\n\nLet's do a full reprise and bring `g` back into the equation,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nf <- function() {\n  \n  text <- \"Here!\"\n  \n  inner <- function() {\n    print(text)\n  }\n  \n  return(inner)\n}\n\ng <- function() {\n  \n  text <- \"There!\"\n  \n  print_text <- f()\n  print_text()\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe now know that when we call `f` - and create `inner` - a closure is created for the `inner` function which allows it to lookup the value of `text`, \"Here!\", when it is invoked.\n\nIn other words, the `inner` function binds values to its 'free' symbols according to *where* it is defined in the source code itself (this is lexical scoping). It does *not*, by contrast, bind its values based on how it is called (this is dynamic scoping).\n\nThe word 'lexical' is used because it is indicative of text or source code. The word 'dynamic' is used because it is indicative of a 'runtime' definition.\n\nTo relate this to the example above,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ng() # lexical scope - R does this\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"Here!\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ng() # dynamic scope - R does not do this\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"There!\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe latter would be an implementation of dynamic scope because, if the variable `text` were scoped at runtime rather than where it was defined in the source code, it would simply look at the call stack (rather than the 'definition stack' if that's even a word) and see `text <- \"There!\"`.\n\n## Why is this cool?\n\nOK, so why does this even matter as a concept? Well, for one you now understanding something better than you did before: is the intrinsic joy of learning not enough for you?\n\nIf you're looking for a cool application, run over to [this chapter](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/function-factories.html#stateful-funs) of Hadley Wickham's book Advanced R to see how you can create a function which counts how many times it has been called!\n",
