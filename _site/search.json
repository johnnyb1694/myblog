    "text": "Cautionary tale…\nA few years ago I was working as a consultant and was asked to perform some data validation for one of our clients.\nMy manager, being the kind of forward-thinking guy he was, decided that we ought to do this in R. I know what you’re thinking: “Forward-thinking? What’s so forward-thinking about R?”. In my defence, I was working in financial services at the time so, to my peers, it was probably a bit like observing a caveman walking around with an iPhone in 10,000 BC.\nAnyway back to the project at hand. What was required, at the time, was (fairly) simple: we needed to process some input data according to various recipes and verify that the numbers reconciled to what the client had generated themselves.\nSimple enough task, you would have thought. Except, I was a budding data analyst who had just graduated from university and had managed to get my hands on a few R projects whilst completing my degree. This meant that I had some ideas for what I wanted to do on this project. In fact, I had lots of ideas.\nWhat this meant is that I didn’t just write the validation scripts: I went all in. It was heavy on functional programming. I encapsulated everything (and I mean everything, no matter how small or insignificant) into modular components. I even added a full-blown logging system to this thing.\nAnd the brutal truth is… I had built an orbital laser to destroy an ant hill.\nWhat was so ironic about this whole experience is that it was precisely my manager who had taught me all of these concepts in the first place. Clearly, I had taken his advice a bit too literally. When he came to review my code, he had some unexpectedly stern words of advice for me: less is more. I had to get rid of most of what I had written. I remember him saying words to the effect of, “We aren’t trying to build a rocket to get us to Mars. We’re trying to build a bike to get us around London”.\nAt the time, I was feeling kind of devastated. All of my hard work had been dismantled before my eyes. I felt like I had done something wrong. And.. to some extent I had done something wrong: I’d over complicated things. I had used esoteric programming paradigms where it wasn’t necessary; I had relied on third-party packages which my team would not have been familiar with; I had tried to encapsulate all components into modules which was complete overkill for a validation script (worse still, some of this encapsulation was just plain wrong: it’s bad practice to put complicated switch() statements into a singular function which makes different decisions based on the input argument i.e. what I had done!)\nBut, in a different context - within a different working environment - my solution may have worked very well!\n\n\nDude, what does this have to do with Shiny?\nOK, I appreciate that this story may have seemed like a little bit of a detour so let me get back to the main topic at hand here...\nLet me start by saying something important: I love Shiny and Shiny is great. It’s great because it allows users to build dashboards without having to know HTML, CSS and JavaScript. That’s pretty cool. PS: if you haven’t checked out Joe Cheng’s keynote talk from rstudio::conf2022, then you really need to! It’s ace.\nInstead, you just need to learn how to use Shiny and the concept of reactivity. I say ‘just’ like this is simple.. It’s not! Learning Shiny takes time and practice. Shiny is like a language in itself that exists within R. In fact, I’m pretty sure that you could learn how to build some pretty slick Shiny apps without knowing much R at all.\nAnd this is typically where you start to run into issues. Building a ‘toy’ app for yourself or in an academic context is fine, as it isn’t likely to get too complicated. Building an enterprise application though? That’s a whole different ballgame. Suddenly you need to think a lot more about how to make your application efficient, maintainable and scalable. These are software development concerns more than anything else.\nOften, all of these concerns are far beyond the skill set of a data analyst who will nonetheless build it out themselves against their best instincts. In this scenario you normally end up with two outcomes:\n\nBeginners: the analyst builds something monolithic: all of the server-side calculations are embedded within the same application as the UI element; data is pulled, in high volumes, straight from a SQL database processed using dplyr . Put bluntly, this is unmaintainable and you can bet that anyone who has to work on this in the future will not be able to parse or amend the codebase\nBeginners.. who don’t realise it: sometimes you get the beginner who discovers how to write Shiny modules so ends up modularising everything. They think they’re gunslinging from the hip but, in reality, all they are doing is creating an overengineered, difficult-to-maintain application for their colleagues. Don’t be that person..!\n\nBoth of these outcomes are bad for your team and that is what matters in an enterprise environment.\nReally, you should only be maintaining Shiny apps if you have the right expertise on your team.\nBut it’s more than that. I would summarise my beliefs on the subject as follows:\n\nYou should only be building a Shiny app if you actually need a Shiny app. Often, there is a simpler solution.\n\n\n\nUse Quarto or R Markdown\nI have found, in my personal experience, that a lot of Shiny apps could probably be written into a R Markdown (or Quarto nowadays) document.\nNow for some hotly-anticipated FAQ’s!\n\n“Hang on Johnny, you can’t use R Markdown or Quarto to do reactivity”. Erm, yes you can! You can add reactive widgets to an R Markdown (or Quarto) document.\n“But isn’t that going to become a mess?”. If your application is simply providing different views of data from a remote database and the reactivity is simple, it won’t become a mess because each ‘chunk’ will basically correspond to a different view. If your application is complicated and there is some kind of non-trivial user workflow, of course: use Shiny!\n\nTo summarise, I am not saying you shouldn’t use Shiny. I am saying you should think long and hard about your decision to use Shiny in the context of (a) your product complexity; and (b) your team!"

    "text": "Well, for me it all starts with what makes somebody a good programmer. When I first learnt how to write code, I didn’t really learn how to write code.\nI learnt how to solve a problem using code as a tool. This was good to some degree - there’s a lot of satisfaction in solving a problem using code. But it was also bad for reasons I would not have been able to perceive at the time.\nYou see, there’s an astronomical difference between writing code for yourself, and writing code for other people (including your future self). In industry, we often do the latter not the former which means that code quality and organisation is paramount.\nBut if you’re sitting a timed exam where ‘getting the answer’ is the most important goal then you understandably have no incentive to improve your code quality. Without wanting to compromise standards too much though, I happen to believe that this approach is sub-optimal.\nPersonally, I am a fan of a coursework-based approach (I’m also a fan of not grading the coursework either). If we simply require candidates to do their best and come up with an interesting angle on an appropriate schema of data using R or Python and issue a simple ‘Pass’ or ‘Fail’, then I can guarantee that they will learn something useful.\nYes, it will be more difficult to mark, but candidates will come away with a much greater understanding of how to write code than they ever would have via an examination format.\nThere is the risk of plagiarism with this approach but I think we ought to be teaching people how to be better software developers, not just trying to maintain standards. If 5% of candidates commit plagiarism, you can be sure they haven’t learnt anything. And ultimately that is their loss. We should accept that these anomalies may slip through the cracks.\nThe other 95% however? They will benefit immensely from a chance to implement their skills in a personal project, regardless of what grade they are given."

    "text": "That said, there are some software engineering ‘best practices’ that you should cherry-pick, if you will, and adopt into your workflow. And here comes my bold statement: I firmly believe that the idea of managing ‘resources’ is one such practice. I know, I know.. ‘managing resources’? You may as well be a librarian.\nBut hear me out: you probably rely on tonnes of ‘resources’ to do your daily work without even realising it. What is your management strategy?\nSorry, I’m getting a bit ahead of myself here. Let’s start with the most fundamental question: what do we mean by the word ‘resource’ exactly?\n\nResources explained\nSuppose you are writing a program which logs result of each operation to a .txt file on disk. Something like this (NB: use Python’s native logger module to perform logging; not what follows!):\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n  logger_file = open('app.log', 'a')\n  logger_file.write(f'Adding {x} and {y}...')\n  z = x / y\n  logger_file.close()\n  return z\n\nYour computer can’t just write this call to the file straight away. If you think about it, a few steps have to happen first:\n\nIf this file is hosted on another machine, your machine needs to gain access to the other machine (and potentially requires authentication)\nThen, pending success on step 1, a connection to this file must be opened\nData is then written into the file via the connection channel\nFinally, on the attempt of step 2 (regardless of success or failure), the connection to the file should be closed\n\nIn this context, your ‘resource’ is the logging file app.log; more formally, a ‘resource’ is a piece of software or hardware that is accessed and manipulated over a network. And, as you can see in the above, you need to manage this resource to avoid complications later down the line.\nWhat kind of complications am I speaking of? Most data analysts will be able to execute steps 1-3 successfully (because, well, they have to). But, again and again, I see far too many analysts fail to carry out step 4, which is the most important step.\n\n\nHow things can go wrong\nThe question you have to ask yourself here is what if the step in between open() and close() fails? In other words, what if z = x / y fails? Well, it will at some point because I have news for you: you can’t divide by zero,\n\ntry:\n  divide(5, 0)\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as err:\n  print(err)\n\ndivision by zero\n\n\nThink about the control flow of our function divide() for a second: once it encounters an error, it will not close the file. Execution will terminate and the connection to our file will be left open. This is not an issue with a small number of connections but imagine that you are running this call, repeatedly, millions of times. There is a cost to maintaining millions of open connections: memory leakage.\nWe are using a contrived example to demonstrate the point here. This issue becomes much more pertinent when interacting with remote database systems.\n\n\nHow to fix it (there’s more than one way)\nSo how can we improve this? Well, we need to make sure we close the file whatever happens. We can achieve this with the try: … except: … else: … finally: … syntax in Python:\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n  try:\n    logger_file = open('app.log', 'a')\n    logger_file.write(f'Adding {x} and {y}...')\n    z = x / y\n  except ZeroDivisionError as err:\n    raise err\n  finally:\n    logger_file.close()\n  return z\n\nWith this syntax in place, any snippets which fall under the finally clause will always be executed regardless of success or failure.\nThe thing is: that’s a lot of boilerplate to be adding to all of your functions and methods. There has to be a simpler way, surely? You’re in luck: Python has a better way.\nYou can build your own context managers by either implementing a class with an __enter__() and __exit()__ method or you can leverage the native Python module contextlib to achieve the same thing. I recommend you check out this link for a thorough explanation of these resources.\n\n\nWhere I find this useful\nI manage database cursors (which are used toe execute queries against a database) using the context management protocol.\nYou can see this with a simple SQLite setup as below,\n\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager \n\nclass SQLite():\n\n    def __init__(self, database_path):\n        self.database_path = database_path\n        self._conn = sqlite3.connect(database_path, detect_types=sqlite3.PARSE_DECLTYPES)\n        self._conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row\n        print('Connection opened.')\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f'SQLite object (path: {self.database_path})'\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        return f'SQLite object (path: {self.database_path})'\n    \n    def close(self):\n        self._conn.close()\n        print('Connection closed.')\n\n    @contextmanager\n    def cursor(self):\n        cursor = self._conn.cursor()\n        try:\n            yield cursor\n        except sqlite3.Error as err:\n            raise err\n        else:\n            self._conn.commit()     \n        finally:\n            cursor.close()\n\nEverything before the yield keyword represents the acquisition of resources (i.e. the cursor). This is followed by the generation of the cursor object. Then, on exit of the method everything below the yield keyword is executed, including the closure of the cursor object.\nPretty neat!"

    "text": "Another day goes by and another poor sod finds themselves trawling through Google to figure out what on earth a closure is.\nWell, I say that as if this is some kind of ‘hot’ topic in the #rstats community: it’s not. If anything it’s ‘hot’ for all the wrong reasons: we’ve all come across the error ‘object of type closure is not subsettable’ before.\nYou can be a very capable data scientist and have no clue what a closure is. But, I actually like this stuff. Plus, this concept is something that is shared amongst other popular programming languages like JavaScript, Swift and Ruby so it’s kind of useful to know what it is.\nSo, presuming you’re not bored yet and still wondering what I’m on about, have a little look at the following code snippet and have a little think about what would happen if I called g. Try to think about it yourself before scrolling further!\nHave you thought about it yet?\nGood. OK: here goes nothing!\nBoom. Now, if you aren’t a regular user of R this behaviour could be quite bemusing. For instance, we have defined two values for the symbol text: how does R select one of them?\nEven if you are a regular user of R, you may still be wondering how to explain this. And you wouldn’t really be able to without first understanding the concept of closures and lexical scope. So let me attempt to elucidate things for you slightly :wink:"

That’s a lot of words!

It does not, by contrast, bind its values based on how it is called (this is dynamic scoping).\nThe word ‘lexical’ is used because it is indicative of text or source code. The word ‘dynamic’ is used because it is indicative of a ‘runtime’ definition.\nTo relate this to the example above,\n\ng() # lexical scope - R does this\n\n[1] \"Here!\"\n\n\n\ng() # dynamic scope - R does not do this\n\n[1] \"There!\"\n\n\nThe latter would be an implementation of dynamic scope because, if the variable text were scoped at runtime rather than where it was defined in the source code, it would simply look at the call stack (rather than the ‘definition stack’ if that’s even a word) and see text <- \"There!\"."
