    "text": "Well, for me it all starts with what makes somebody a good programmer. When I first learnt how to write code, I didn’t really learn how to write code.\nI learnt how to solve a problem using code as a tool. This was good to some degree - there’s a lot of satisfaction in solving a problem using code. But it was also bad for reasons I would not have been able to perceive at the time.\nYou see, there’s an astronomical difference between writing code for yourself, and writing code for other people (including your future self). In industry, we often do the latter not the former which means that code quality and organisation is paramount.\nBut if you’re sitting a timed exam where ‘getting the answer’ is the most important goal then you understandably have no incentive to improve your code quality. Without wanting to compromise standards too much though, I happen to believe that this approach is sub-optimal.\nPersonally, I am a fan of a coursework-based approach (I’m also a fan of not grading the coursework either). If we simply require candidates to do their best and come up with an interesting angle on an appropriate schema of data using R or Python and issue a simple ‘Pass’ or ‘Fail’, then I can guarantee that they will learn something useful.\nYes, it will be more difficult to mark, but candidates will come away with a much greater understanding of how to write code than they ever would have via an examination format.\nThere is the risk of plagiarism with this approach but I think we ought to be teaching people how to be better software developers, not just trying to maintain standards. If 5% of candidates commit plagiarism, you can be sure they haven’t learnt anything. And ultimately that is their loss. We should accept that these anomalies may slip through the cracks.\nThe other 95% however? They will benefit immensely from a chance to implement their skills in a personal project, regardless of what grade they are given."

    "text": "Another day goes by and another poor sod finds themselves trawling through Google to figure out what on earth a closure is.\nWell, I say that as if this is some kind of ‘hot’ topic in the #rstats community: it’s not. If anything it’s ‘hot’ for all the wrong reasons: we’ve all come across the error ‘object of type closure is not subsettable’ before.\nYou can be a very capable data scientist and have no clue what a closure is. But, I actually like this stuff. Plus, this concept is something that is shared amongst other popular programming languages like JavaScript, Swift and Ruby so it’s kind of useful to know what it is.\nSo, presuming you’re not bored yet and still wondering what I’m on about, have a little look at the following code snippet and have a little think about what would happen if I called g. Try to think about it yourself before scrolling further!\nHave you thought about it yet?\nGood. OK: here goes nothing!\nBoom. Now, if you aren’t a regular user of R this behaviour could be quite bemusing. For instance, we have defined two values for the symbol text: how does R select one of them?\nEven if you are a regular user of R, you may still be wondering how to explain this. And you wouldn’t really be able to without first understanding the concept of closures and lexical scope. So let me attempt to elucidate things for you slightly :wink:"

First, take a look at this function\n\nopen <- function() {\n  x + 3\n}\n\nYou’ll see why I’ve called it ‘open’ in a minute.\nMost users of R understand that if we tried to run open, as is, we would face an error because we haven’t yet defined a value for x within the function body or within the global environment.\nLet’s verify that with a quick call,\n\nopen()\n\nError in open(): object 'x' not found\n\n\nThis of course changes once we assign a value to the symbol x, say, within the global environment,\n\nx <- 2\n\nopen()\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nThe question is: how does open locate a value for the symbol x? I mean, we haven’t defined it inside the function body so how does open ‘jump up’ into the global environment whilst it is executing?"

We call x a free variable in this context. It needs a value; it needs closure.\nWhen we created open, we assigned it to the global environment,\n\nrlang::env_has(env = .GlobalEnv, nms = \"open\")\n\nopen \nTRUE \n\n\nWhen you define a function inside a given context (say, the global environment, as we just did), that function will assign and maintain values associated with all of the free variables of that function expression which exist within the surrounding context (and the context surrounding that context and so on, recursively).\nPhew. That’s a lot of words! Let’s look at an example to make this a little easier to understand.\nFor example,\n\nt <- 1\nu <- 2\nv <- 3\nx <- 10\n\nopen <- function() {\n  x + 3\n}\n\nIn this case, the surrounding environment of open is as follows:\n\n# Surrounding context of 'open'\n{\n  t: 1,\n  u: 2,\n  v: 3,\n  x: 10\n}\n\nThe closure of open is a subset of this environment: it is the set of key-value pairs which transform open from an open expression into a closed expression. In this case, we only care about x,\n\n# Closure of 'open'\n{\n  x: 10\n}\n\nThis is what a closure is!"

So think of ‘call f’ and ‘define inner’ as being equivalent statements.\nWhen you run f(), here’s what happens.\nFirst, you create another function (which I have just named print_text),\n\nprint_text <- f()\n\nprint_text\n\nfunction() {\n    print(text)\n  }\n<environment: 0x12004e7b8>\n\n\nHowever, something else also happens behind the scenes which you don’t see: upon definition, the inner function creates a snapshot of the free variables (i.e. text) in its surrounding context,\n\n{\n  text: \"Here!\"\n}\n\nIn effect, the inner function ‘encloses’ its surrounding context.\nThis is the closure of inner and this is how inner gets a value for text. This value is maintained even after f finishes executing."

It does not, by contrast, bind its values based on how it is called (this is dynamic scoping).\nThe word ‘lexical’ is used because it is indicative of text or source code. The word ‘dynamic’ is used because it is indicative of a ‘runtime’ definition.\nTo relate this to the example above,\n\ng() # lexical scope - R does this\n\n[1] \"Here!\"\n\n\n\ng() # dynamic scope - R does not do this\n\n[1] \"There!\"\n\n\nThe latter would be an implementation of dynamic scope because, if the variable text were scoped at runtime rather than where it was defined in the source code, it would simply look at the call stack (rather than the ‘definition stack’ if that’s even a word) and see text <- \"There!\"."

    "section": "",
    "text": "That said, there are some software engineering ‘best practices’ that you should cherry-pick, if you will, and adopt into your workflow. And here comes my bold statement: I firmly believe that the idea of managing ‘resources’ is one such practice. I know, I know.. ‘managing resources’? You may as well be a librarian.\nBut hear me out: you probably rely on tonnes of ‘resources’ to do your daily work without even realising it. What is your management strategy?\nSorry, I’m getting a bit ahead of myself here. Let’s start with the most fundamental question: what do we mean by the word ‘resource’ exactly?\n\nResources explained\nSuppose you are writing a program which logs result of each operation to a .txt file on disk. Something like this (NB: use Python’s native logger module to perform logging; not what follows!):\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n  logger_file = open('app.log', 'a')\n  logger_file.write(f'Adding {x} and {y}...')\n  z = x / y\n  logger_file.close()\n  return z\n\nYour computer can’t just write this call to the file straight away. If you think about it, a few steps have to happen first:\n\nIf this file is hosted on another machine, your machine needs to gain access to the other machine (and potentially requires authentication)\nThen, pending success on step 1, a connection to this file must be opened\nData is then written into the file via the connection channel\nFinally, on the attempt of step 2 (regardless of success or failure), the connection to the file should be closed\n\nIn this context, your ‘resource’ is the logging file app.log; more formally, a ‘resource’ is a piece of software or hardware that is accessed and manipulated over a network. And, as you can see in the above, you need to manage this resource to avoid complications later down the line.\nWhat kind of complications am I speaking of? Most data analysts will be able to execute steps 1-3 successfully (because, well, they have to). But, again and again, I see far too many analysts fail to carry out step 4, which is the most important step.\n\n\nHow things can go wrong\nThe question you have to ask yourself here is what if the step in between open() and close() fails? In other words, what if z = x / y fails? Well, it will at some point because I have news for you: you can’t divide by zero,\n\ntry:\n  divide(5, 0)\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as err:\n  print(err)\n\ndivision by zero\n\n\nThink about the control flow of our function divide() for a second: once it encounters an error, it will not close the file. Execution will terminate and the connection to our file will be left open. This is not an issue with a small number of connections but imagine that you are running this call, repeatedly, millions of times. There is a cost to maintaining millions of open connections: memory leakage.\nWe are using a contrived example to demonstrate the point here. This issue becomes much more pertinent when interacting with remote database systems.\n\n\nHow to fix it (there’s more than one way)\nSo how can we improve this? Well, we need to make sure we close the file whatever happens. We can achieve this with the try: … except: … else: … finally: … syntax in Python:\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n  try:\n    logger_file = open('app.log', 'a')\n    logger_file.write(f'Adding {x} and {y}...')\n    z = x / y\n  except ZeroDivisionError as err:\n    raise err\n  finally:\n    logger_file.close()\n  return z\n\nWith this syntax in place, any snippets which fall under the finally clause will always be executed regardless of success or failure.\nThe thing is: that’s a lot of boilerplate to be adding to all of your functions and methods. There has to be a simpler way, surely? You’re in luck: Python has a better way.\nYou can build your own context managers by either implementing a class with an __enter__() and __exit()__ method or you can leverage the native Python module contextlib to achieve the same thing. I recommend you check out this link for a thorough explanation of these resources.\n\n\nWhere I find this useful\nI manage database cursors (which are used toe execute queries against a database) using the context management protocol.\nYou can see this with a simple SQLite setup as below,\n\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager \n\nclass SQLite():\n\n    def __init__(self, database_path):\n        self.database_path = database_path\n        self._conn = sqlite3.connect(database_path, detect_types=sqlite3.PARSE_DECLTYPES)\n        self._conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row\n        print('Connection opened.')\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f'SQLite object (path: {self.database_path})'\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        return f'SQLite object (path: {self.database_path})'\n    \n    def close(self):\n        self._conn.close()\n        print('Connection closed.')\n\n    @contextmanager\n    def cursor(self):\n        cursor = self._conn.cursor()\n        try:\n            yield cursor\n        except sqlite3.Error as err:\n            raise err\n        else:\n            self._conn.commit()     \n        finally:\n            cursor.close()\n\nEverything before the yield keyword represents the acquisition of resources (i.e. the cursor). This is followed by the generation of the cursor object. Then, on exit of the method everything below the yield keyword is executed, including the closure of the cursor object.\nPretty neat!"
