    "text": "Well, for me it all starts with what makes somebody a good programmer. When I first learnt how to write code, I didn’t really learn how to write code.\nI learnt how to solve a problem using code as a tool. This was good to some degree - there’s a lot of satisfaction in solving a problem using code. But it was also bad for reasons I would not have been able to perceive at the time.\nYou see, there’s an astronomical difference between writing code for yourself, and writing code for other people (including your future self). In industry, we often do the latter not the former which means that code quality and organisation is paramount.\nBut if you’re sitting a timed exam where ‘getting the answer’ is the most important goal then you understandably have no incentive to improve your code quality. Without wanting to compromise standards too much though, I happen to believe that this approach is sub-optimal.\nPersonally, I am also a fan of a coursework-based approach (I’m also a fan of not grading the coursework either). If we simply require candidates to do their best and come up with an interesting angle on an appropriate schema of data using R or Python and issue a simple ‘Pass’ or ‘Fail’, then I can guarantee that they will learn something useful.\nYes, it will be more difficult to mark, but candidates will come away with a much greater understanding of how to write code than they ever would have via an examination format.\nThere is the risk of plagiarism with this approach but I think we ought to be teaching people how to be better software developers, not just trying to maintain standards. If 5% of candidates commit plagiarism, you can be sure they haven’t learnt anything. And ultimately that is their loss. We should accept that these anomalies may slip through the cracks.\nThe other 95% however? They will benefit immensely from a chance to implement their skills in a personal project, regardless of what grade they are given."

    "text": "Another day goes by and another poor sod finds themselves trawling through Google to figure out what on earth a closure is.\nWell, I say that as if this is some kind of ‘hot’ topic in the #rstats community: it’s not. If anything it’s ‘hot’ for all the wrong reasons: we’ve all come across the error ‘object of type closure is not subsettable’ before.\nYou can be a very capable data scientist and have no clue what a closure is. But, I actually like this stuff. Plus, this concept is something that is shared amongst other popular programming languages like JavaScript, Swift and Ruby so it’s kind of useful to know what it is.\nSo, presuming you’re not bored yet and still wondering what I’m on about, have a little look at the following code snippet and have a little think about what would happen if I called g. Try to think about it yourself before scrolling further!\nHave you thought about it yet?\nGood. OK: here goes nothing!\nBoom. Now, if you aren’t a regular user of R this behaviour could be quite bemusing. For instance, we have defined two values for the symbol text: how does R select one of them?\nEven if you are a regular user of R, you may still be wondering how to explain this. And you wouldn’t really be able to without first understanding the concept of closures and lexical scope. So let me attempt to elucidate things for you slightly :wink:"

First, take a look at this function\n\nopen <- function() {\n  x + 3\n}\n\nYou’ll see why I’ve called it ‘open’ in a minute.\nMost users of R understand that if we tried to run open, as is, we would face an error because we haven’t yet defined a value for x within the function body or within the global environment.\nLet’s verify that with a quick call,\n\nopen()\n\nError in open(): object 'x' not found\n\n\nThis of course changes once we assign a value to the symbol x, say, within the global environment,\n\nx <- 2\n\nopen()\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nThe question is: how does open locate a value for the symbol x? I mean, we haven’t defined it inside the function body so how does open ‘jump up’ into the global environment whilst it is executing?"

    "text": "Expressions & closures\nTake a look at the following function closed,\n\nclosed <- function(x, y) {\n  x + y\n}\n\nThis function is a closed expression because each and every symbol that is defined inside the body of g has a corresponding value (supplied as arguments to the parameters x and y).\nBy contrast, the aforementioned function open is an open expression,\n\nopen <- function() {\n  x + 3\n}\n\nThis is because the symbol x is not defined anywhere within the function itself. We call x a free variable in this context. It needs a value; it needs closure.\nWhen we created open, we assigned it to the global environment,\n\nrlang::env_has(env = .GlobalEnv, nms = \"open\")\n\nopen \nTRUE \n\n\nWhen you define a function inside a given context (say, the global environment, as we just did), that function will assign and maintain values associated with all of the free variables of that function expression which exist within the surrounding context (and the context surrounding that context and so on, recursively).\nPhew. That’s a lot of words! Let’s look at an example to make this a little easier to understand.\nFor example,\n\nt <- 1\nu <- 2\nv <- 3\nx <- 10\n\nopen <- function() {\n  x + 3\n}\n\nIn this case, the surrounding environment of open is as follows:\n\n# Surrounding context of 'open'\n{\n  t: 1,\n  u: 2,\n  v: 3,\n  x: 10\n}\n\nThe closure of open is a subset of this environment: it is the set of key-value pairs which transform open from an open expression into a closed expression. In this case, we only care about x,\n\n# Closure of 'open'\n{\n  x: 10\n}\n\nThis is what a closure is!"

So think of ‘call f’ and ‘define inner’ as being equivalent statements.\nWhen you run f(), here’s what happens.\nFirst, you create another function (which I have just named print_text),\n\nprint_text <- f()\n\nprint_text\n\nfunction() {\n    print(text)\n  }\n<environment: 0x12004e7b8>\n\n\nHowever, something else also happens behind the scenes which you don’t see: upon definition, the inner function creates a snapshot of the free variables (i.e. text) in its surrounding context,\n\n{\n  text: \"Here!\"\n}\n\nIn effect, the inner function ‘encloses’ its surrounding context.\nThis is the closure of inner and this is how inner gets a value for text. This value is maintained even after f finishes executing."

    "text": "Lexical scope versus dynamic scope\nThe concept of closures is closely related to the concept of lexical scope.\nLet’s do a full reprise and bring g back into the equation,\n\nf <- function() {\n  \n  text <- \"Here!\"\n  \n  inner <- function() {\n    print(text)\n  }\n  \n  return(inner)\n}\n\ng <- function() {\n  \n  text <- \"There!\"\n  \n  print_text <- f()\n  print_text()\n}\n\nWe now know that when we call f - and create inner - a closure is created for the inner function which allows it to lookup the value of text, “Here!”, when it is invoked.\nIn other words, the inner function binds values to its ‘free’ symbols according to where it is defined in the source code itself (this is lexical scoping). It does not, by contrast, bind its values based on how it is called (this is dynamic scoping).\nThe word ‘lexical’ is used because it is indicative of text or source code. The word ‘dynamic’ is used because it is indicative of a ‘runtime’ definition.\nTo relate this to the example above,\n\ng() # lexical scope - R does this\n\n[1] \"Here!\"\n\n\n\ng() # dynamic scope - R does not do this\n\n[1] \"There!\"\n\n\nThe latter would be an implementation of dynamic scope because, if the variable text were scoped at runtime rather than where it was defined in the source code, it would simply look at the call stack (rather than the ‘definition stack’ if that’s even a word) and see text <- \"There!\"."
