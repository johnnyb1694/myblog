Why is it so difficult to write a timed exam to assess somebody's programming skills?

Well, for me it all starts with what makes somebody a good programmer. When I first learnt how to write code, I didn't really learn how to *write code*.

I learnt how to solve a problem using code as a tool. This was good to some degree - there's a lot of satisfaction in solving a problem using code. But it was also bad for reasons I would not have been able to perceive at the time.

You see, there's an astronomical difference between writing code for yourself, and writing code for other people (including your future self). In industry, we often do the latter not the former which means that code quality and organisation is paramount.

But if you're sitting a timed exam where 'getting the answer' is the most important goal then you understandably have no incentive to improve your code quality. Without wanting to compromise standards too much though, I happen to believe that this approach is sub-optimal.

Personally, I am a fan of a coursework-based approach (I'm also a fan of not grading the coursework either). If we simply require candidates to do their best and come up with an interesting angle on an appropriate schema of data using R or Python and issue a simple 'Pass' or 'Fail', then I can guarantee that they will learn something useful.

Yes, it will be more difficult to mark, but candidates will come away with a much greater understanding of how to write code than they ever would have via an examination format.

There is the risk of plagiarism with this approach but I think we ought to be teaching people how to be better software developers, not *just* trying to maintain standards. If 5% of candidates commit plagiarism, you can be sure they haven't learnt anything. And ultimately that is *their* loss. We should accept that these anomalies may slip through the cracks.

The other 95% however? They will benefit immensely from a chance to implement their skills in a personal project, regardless of what grade they are given.
